# Build and Deploy After Changes

After making code changes to this project, always do ALL of these steps:

1. **Build** the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. **Commit and push to GitHub** (triggers GitHub Pages auto-deploy):
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "description of changes" && git push origin main
```

3. **Deploy to Quick** (requires manual confirmation -- prompt the user to run in their terminal):
```bash
quick deploy dist whats4dinner
```
Note: Quick deploy requires interactive confirmation and cannot be automated. Always remind the user to run this command in their terminal after pushing to GitHub.

Never skip any of these steps. Every code change must be built, pushed, and deployed.
