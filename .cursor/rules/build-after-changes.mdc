# Build and Deploy After Changes

After making code changes to this project, always do both of these steps:

1. **Rebuild dist** for Quick deployment:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. **Commit and push to GitHub** so GitHub Pages auto-deploys:
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "description of changes" && git push
```

Always do both steps after every code change. Never skip either one.
