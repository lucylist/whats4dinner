# Version Command

When the user says **"version"** (on its own or as part of a message like "version this"):

1. **Stage all changes**: `git add -A`
2. **Commit** with a message summarizing what changed since the last version tag, prefixed with the version number (e.g., `v1.2.0 — Brief summary`)
3. **Tag** the commit with the version number (e.g., `git tag v1.2.0`)
4. **Bump** the `version` field in `package.json` to match
5. **Report** the version number and a one-line summary to the user

## Versioning scheme

- Use semver: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Increment **MINOR** for new features or visual redesigns
- Increment **PATCH** for bug fixes, contrast tweaks, small adjustments
- Increment **MAJOR** only if the user explicitly requests it

## Reverting

If the user says **"revert to v1.1.0"** (or any version):

1. Run `git log --oneline --all` to confirm the tag exists
2. Run `git checkout v1.1.0` (or the requested tag)
3. Confirm with the user before any hard reset to main
